The `deploy-to-azure.yaml` is configured to run after a successful [Build, Test, and Publish](./build-test-publish) workflow run.
It takes the build artifact and publishes it to an Azure App Service.

It is disabled by default.

## Usage

1. Set up your Azure environment (app service and database).
2. Create a repo secret `AZURE_APP_SERVICE_NAME` and set it to the name of your app service (like `my-app-service`).
3. Create a repo secret `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` and paste in the contents of your
  [downloaded publish profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/azure/how-to-get-publish-profile-from-azure-app-service).
4. Create a repo variable `RUN_DEPLOY_TO_AZURE_APP_SERVICE` and set it to `true`.
