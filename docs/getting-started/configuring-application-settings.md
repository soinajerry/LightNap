Application settings need to be [configured in `appsettings.json`](./application-configuration) or your deployment host.

- `ApplicationSettings.AutomaticallyApplyEfMigrations`: `true` to automatically apply Entity Framework migrations. If this is set to false, EF migrations must be manually applied. This setting is ignored for non-relational databases like the in-memory provider.
- `ApplicationSettings.LogOutInactiveDeviceDays`: The number of days of inactivity (no contact) before a device is logged out.
- `ApplicationSettings.RequireTwoFactorForNewUsers`: `true` to require two-factor email authentication for new users. It does not change existing users.
- `ApplicationSettings.SiteUrlRootForEmails`: The root URL used in emails. This should be the base URL where the Angular app is hosted from (e.g., `https://localhost:4200/` in development).
- `ApplicationSettings.UseSameSiteStrictCookies`: `true` to use SameSite strict cookies. Set this to `false` if debugging the front-end from a different URL root (like `http://localhost:4200/` for Angular).
